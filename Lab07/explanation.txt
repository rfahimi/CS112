The difference in behavior between the Integer and MyInt classes is due to their mutability.

Since Integer objects 'x' are immutable, their values cannot be modified in place.
Each operation that modifies the value 'DoubleMe(x)' creates a new object.
If the new Integer object is not assigned to a variable, the value is effectively discarded after a single use.

In contrast, MyInt objects 'y' are mutable. 
Their values can be modified in place by their member functions 'y.DoubleMe()' without creating a new object.
