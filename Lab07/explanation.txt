In the 'FunWithInteger()' function, two 'Integer' objects 'x' and 'y' are initialized and assigned the value '1'.
Since 'Integer' objects are immutable, the 'DoubleMe(Integer arg)' function cannot modify the original value of 'x', but instead returns a new value.
In the first call to 'DoubleMe(x)', the value of 'x' remains unchanged, and the returned value is not assigned to anything, so it is effectively discarded.
In the second call to 'DoubleMe(x)', the returned value is assigned to 'y', so the value of 'y' becomes '2', while the value of 'x' remains '1'.
In the third call to 'DoubleMe(y)', the returned value of '4' is assigned to 'x', so the value of 'x' becomes '4', while the value of 'y' remains '2'.
Finally, in the fourth call to 'DoubleMe(x)', the returned value of '8' is assigned to 'x', so the value of 'x' becomes '8', while the value of 'y' remains '2'.

In the 'FunWithMyInt()' function, two 'MyInt' objects 'x' and 'y' are initialized and assigned the value '1'.
Since 'MyInt' objects are mutable, the member functions can modify the 'm_value' of the objects.
In the first call to 'x.DoubleMe()', the m_value of 'x' becomes '2', while the 'm_value' of 'y' remains '1'.
In the second call to 'y.set(x.DoubleMe())', the 'm_value' of 'x' becomes '4'.
This value is then set as the 'm_value' of 'y', so the 'm_value' of 'y' becomes '4' 
In the third call to 'y.DoubleMe(x)', the 'DoubleMe(MyInt arg)' function is called on the 'x' object, which doubles its 'm_value' and returns '8'.
This value is then set as the 'm_value' of 'y', so the 'm_value' of 'y' becomes '8'.
At this point, the m_value of 'x' is '8'.
In the fourth call to 'x.set(x.DoubleMe(x))', the 'DoubleMe(MyInt arg)' function is called on the 'x' object again, which doubles its 'm_value' and returns '16'.
This value is then redundantly set as the 'm_value' of 'x', so the 'm_value' of 'x' remains '16'.
In the final call to 'y.DoubleMe()', the 'm_value' of 'y' is doubled, so it becomes '16'.

In summary, the difference in behavior between the 'Integer' and 'MyInt' classes is due to their mutability.
Since 'Integer' objects are immutable, their values cannot be modified in place, so each operation that modifies the value creates a new object.
On the other hand, since 'MyInt' objects are mutable, their values can be modified in place by their member functions.
As a result, the operations performed on 'MyInt' objects modify the values of the objects themselves, while the operations performed on 'Integer' objects create new objects with modified values.
